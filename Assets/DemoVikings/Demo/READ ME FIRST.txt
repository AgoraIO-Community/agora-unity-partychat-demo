	Third Person MMO Controller demo
	
	----
	
	As specified in the ThirdPersonController inspector, a custom axis
	and a custom button needs to be defined before use. This applies
	to the demo as well.
	
	You can access the input definitions of your projects in:
	
		Edit -> Project Settings -> Input
	
	The needed additional input is as follows:
	
		"ToggleWalk"
		Set up precisely as the "Jump" button - only with the positive
		button set to '+' or whichever button you find appropriate.
		
		"Sidestep"
		Set up precisely as the "Horizontal" axis - only with the
		negative and positive buttons changed to 'q' and 'e' and the
		alt negative and positive buttons cleared.
	
	With these modifications to your input settings, you will be able
	to play the demo and use the third person controller component.
